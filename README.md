# Rise, a light-based alarm
This is a personal project where an alarm can be set using a dial and instead of a tone waking the user, LED lights gradually increase in brightness, waking the user more gradually.

## Concept
This is a small, battery powered project utilizing the PIC16F1827 and DS3231 RTC. Using a dial, which forms the housing of the device, a wake-up time can be set. When that alarm triggers the LED's gradually increase in brightness over 5 minutes and stay lit for 15 minunites allowing the user to wake up.
